This project is a virtualization framework for Intel processors written entirely in C. 
It includes basic virtualization and virtualization exit functionalities. 
The code is elegant, simple, and highly compatible, making it ideal for beginners to learn and use. 
Please do not run anti-cheat programs after virtualizing the processor. If you do, you may encounter errors such as blue screens or system crashes.
If you have any questions or encounter any bugs, please feel free to email me at 1003848372@qq.com.
